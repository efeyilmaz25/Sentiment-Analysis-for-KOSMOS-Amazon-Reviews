# Sentiment_Analysis_for_KOSMOS_Amazon_Reviews

----- Business Problem -----

Kozmos, which produces products focused on home textiles and daily wear 
and sells through Amazon, aims to increase its sales by analyzing the 
comments on its products and improving its features according to the 
complaints it receives. In line with this goal, the comments will be 
labeled by sentiment analysis and a classification model will be 
created with the labeled data.


----- Data-Set Story -----

The data set consists of variables indicating the comments made on a 
particular product group, the comment title, the number of stars, and 
how many people found the comment useful.
